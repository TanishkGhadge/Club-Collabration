		<h3>GDSC <br></h3>
		<p>Joining the (GDSC) has been a turning point in my journey as a tech enthusiast. This vibrant community at our university brings together students passionate about learning, building, and sharing knowledge in Google developer technologies and beyond.
			What sets GDSC apart is its vision of empowering students with real-world technical skills and fostering innovation. Through hands-on workshops, insightful talks, and collaborative projects, the club creates an environment where learning meets creativity. GDSC not only focuses on individual growth but also on solving real-world problems, making every project meaningful.
			Being a member, I’ve enhanced my technical expertise in areas like app development, web technologies, and cloud computing. Additionally, working on team projects taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and adaptability. The exposure to a professional network of developers and tech leaders has also been invaluable for my career growth.
			Above all, it’s inspiring to be part of a group that encourages innovation, supports each other, and collectively strives to make an impact in the tech world. I’m proud to contribute to this incredible mission and would highly recommend others to be a part of this transformative journey.

		<h3>Indore Cancer Foundation<br></h3>
		<p>Being a part of the Indore Cancer Foundation - SVVV Chapter has been a profoundly enriching experience. Our club is dedicated to making a tangible difference in the lives of cancer patients by raising funds through engaging events like Raasrang, our signature fundraiser event.
			The foundation stands for compassion, commitment, and community. It has a vision of creating awareness about cancer and supporting patients and their families in their fight against this life-altering disease. What inspires me the most is seeing how every small contribution and collective effort brings hope to those in need.
			As a member, I’ve learned the true value of teamwork and the power of organizing events that blend creativity with purpose. From planning to execution, each step taught me how collaboration and dedication can turn a simple idea into a meaningful impact. Additionally, it helped me develop leadership, communication, and event management skills while fostering empathy and gratitude.
			Indore Cancer Foundation is more than a club - it’s a movement driven by the vision of a world where no one fights cancer alone. I’m proud to be a part of it and would urge others to join hands with us in this noble cause.</p>

		<h3>Prayatna <br></h3>
		<p>Being a part of Prayatna has been one of the most transformative experiences of my life. This club is more than just an organization, it’s a family committed to empowering underprivileged students through education in computer skills and English.
			As a club member, I’ve had the privilege of teaching students directly, conducting workshops, and witnessing their growth firsthand. It’s deeply fulfilling to see a spark of curiosity in their eyes turn into confidence as they learn new concepts.
			Through this journey, I’ve honed my leadership, communication, and teaching skills. Working in a team of like-minded peers has taught me the value of collaboration and perseverance. Every workshop and interaction reminded me how small efforts can make a big impact.
			Prayatna is not just about giving, it’s also about learning. It has shown me the power of community, the importance of learning, and the joy of making a difference.
			I would encourage everyone to support and get involved with Prayatna. Together, we can continue to uplift lives and build a brighter future.</p>
